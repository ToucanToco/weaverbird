/**
 * This module provides the basic type machinery to build pipeline
 * translators efficiently and safely.
 *
 * It exposes 2 main building blocks:
 * - `StepMatcher`: a type mapping each available pipeline steps to a
 *   translation function
 * - `matchStep`: a function accepting a `StepMatcher` and that return a function
 *   transforming a pipeline step to an arbiratry output.
 *
 * This system is supposed to be typesafe, which means that if you add a
 * new type of `PipelineStep`, the typescript compiler is expected to fail
 * if your matcher implementation doesn't provide a mapping for this new kind
 * of step.
