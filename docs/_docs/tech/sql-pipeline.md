## Steps definition

This document describes the steps that can be used in our SQL Translator pipeline. A step is
the unit of transformation generated by a user interaction with the SQL visual query
builder.

## Implementation logic 

The steps were implemented using the following concepts: 
- A step is named following this convention: **<OPERATION_NAME>\_STEP\_<STEP_INDEX>**
- A pipeline starts with a select step using the query provided by the user like below
```
WITH SELECT_STEP_0 AS (<USER'S QUERY STRING>)
```
- Each step concatenates the resulting query string it generates to the query string received in input
For example, a *SelectStep* followed by a *FilterStep* results in
```
WITH SELECT_STEP_0 AS (<USER'S QUERY STRING>),
FILTER_STEP_1 AS (SELECT * FROM SELECT_STEP_0 WHERE PRICE > 10)
```
- Each step updates the final **selection query** with its name
For example, the query string sent to the data provider for a *SelectStep* followed by a *FilterStep* would be
```
WITH SELECT_STEP_0 AS (<USER'S QUERY STRING>),
FILTER_STEP_1 AS (SELECT * FROM SELECT_STEP_0 WHERE PRICE > 10)
SELECT * FROM FILTER_STEP_1
```
