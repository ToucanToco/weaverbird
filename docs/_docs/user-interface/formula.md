### Formula

You can use this step to create a column as a formula based on other columns.
A column can be referenced by its name without quotes unless they include
whitespaces, in such a case you need to use brackets '[]' (e.g. \[myColumn]).

Any characters string escaped with quotes (simple or double) will be considered
as a string.

The supported operators are : addition (`+`), substraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), modulo (`%`).

**This step is supported by the following backends:**

- Mongo 5.0
- Mongo 4.2
- Mongo 4.0
- Mongo 3.6
- Pandas (python)

- `New column`: the name of the new column to be created with the formula
  result.

- `Formula`: the formula, which can be an algebraic formula composed of numbers,
  maths operators and columns; it can also be a text (escaped by quotes) to
  uniformly fill the column with that text.
