  Staurday) from date,

  from date.
- `ISO week`: extract 'week number' in ISO 8601 format (ranging from 1 to 53)
  from date.

  Monday to 7 for Sunday) from date,
- `first day of year`: calendar date corresponding to the first day (1st of January) of the year ,
- `first day of month`: calendar date corresponding to the first day of the month,

- `first day of ISO week`: calendar date corresponding to the first day of the week in ISO 8601 format,
- `previous day`: calendar date one day before the target date,
- `first day of previous year`: calendar date corresponding to the first day (1st of January) of the previous year,
- `first day of previous month`: calendar date corresponding to the first day of the previous month,
- `first day of previous week`: calendar date corresponding to the first day of the previous week,
- `first day of previous ISO week`: calendar date corresponding to the first day of the previous ISO week,
- `first day of previous quarter`: calendar date corresponding to the first day of the previous quarter,
- `previous year number`: extract previous 'year number' from date,
- `previous month number`: extract previous 'month number' from date,
