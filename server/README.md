# weaverbird python package

See [docs about purpose and usage](../docs/_docs/tech/python-package.md).

## Development

We use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for managing dependencies.

Main commands are available through `make`:

    make install # Install dependencies & set up pre-commit

    make format # Fix formatting issues using black and ruff
    make lint # Execute various checks

    make build # Build the project prior to publication
    make upload # Publish on pypi

    make test # Execute the test suite and produce reports
    /!\ To run Snowflake's e2e tests, the password needs to be exported to env variables
    as such: export SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD='XXXXXXXXXXX'. This password is available in lastpass (user: toucan_test)

### Playground server

See `playground.py`. It provides a very simple server to test the module.
